        <h1>Michael T Bolla Magic Mirror Project</h1>
            <h2>To Get a C, you need to:</h2>
            <p><strong>Provide the Sketch of the Magic Mirror interface</strong></p>
            <h3>MTB Magic Mirror Sketch Interface</h3>
            <center><img src="p2.Michael.Bolla.PNG" alt="p2.Michael.Bolla.PNG"
                width ="600" 
                length ="500"  /> </center>
            <p><strong>In my Magic Mirror Sketch Interface I included</strong></p>
            <p>General Information</p>
            <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>A personalized calendar at the topleft.</li>
            <li>A news feed on the top right.</li>
            <li>I created a notification hub underneath the news that includes text messages, social messages and information, and just basic notification updates.</li>
            <li>I included local weather information right underneath the calendar because i believed the two fit near each other.</li>
            <li>I also included health information underneath the local weather that includes weight information, sleep time, exercise time, steps from the previous day, and even total mirror time.</li>
            <li>I added a Date and Time indicator at the top middle of the screen so the user can easily spot that information.</li>
            <li>Lastly I added two buttons to the bottem middle of the screen for the user, one button is for music because who doesnt want music in their morning routines and also a power button to turn off the additional features and just use a regular mirror.</li>
            </ul>

    
            <h2>To Get a B, you need to: Explain the implementation of the mirror and how it works</h2>
            <h3><strong>Processing Mirror Design Gif</strong></h3>
            <center><img src="p2.Michael.Bolla.gif" alt="p2.Michael.Bolla.gif"
                width ="600" 
                length ="500"  /> </center>

            <p><strong>Gif explained:</strong></p>
            <p>The gif shows representation on how the mirror works.</p>
            <p>You can see how all the information is displayed on the screen based on my sketch.</p>
            <p>The gif also shows how when I click the mirrors power button it acts like a normal mirror for the user.</p>
            <p>Funny Note: My head is dancing cause I played the music button but the gif isnt playing the music, you will hear the music in the video presentation down below!</p>

            <p><strong>Important things to note on how my design works and how to run the code!:</strong></p>
            <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>In order to run the code, you must complete the following steps.</li>
                <li>Step 1: You must import all the files from the repository involving CSV files, Helvetica-Bold.ttf, as well as the Sunday-morning-mp3.</li>
                <li>Step 2: You must make sure the processing ide has the correct sound library installed, to do this go to tools -> manage tools -> install sound library, in this case you must install the Sound Library - author is the The Processing Foundation.</li>
                <li>Step 3: You must make sure the processing ide has the correct video library installed, to do this go to tools -> manage tools -> install Video library, in this case you must install the video library for processing 4 Library - author is the The Processing Foundation.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><strong>Implementations Explanations</strong></p>
            <p>I created csv files using Microsoft Excel for my personalized calendar, news feed, local weather and notifications for the general information provided on the mirror.</p>
            <p>I also created another csv file for the health information on the magic mirror for the case of weight and how it compares to the previous weeks data.</p>
            <p>I was able to implement these to the processing sketch by creating table objects in processing then loading the specific CSV file to each table variable and outputing them to the final sketch.</p>
            <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Little side note, the Microsoft Excel files were saved as CSV UTF-8 (Comma Delimited)(*.csv) files. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>I added some personal utilities to my designs as well</strong></p>
            <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>At the top of the screen, I created a date for the user that updates and provides the Month, Day, and Year using the built in processing functions .</li>
                <li>At the top of the screen next to the date, I created the time for the user as well that updates and provides the exact time down to the seconds for the users who could maybe be running late, this was done using the built in processing functions.</li>
                <li>I also imported the video library to help give the mirror a more realistic feel to it.</li>
                <li>Utilizing my camera which was a Logitech 1080p C920s Pro HD Webcam, I was able to create a mirror like reflection in my design, to show show how a user can be reflected while all the information is provided on the screen that the user would want.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>To Get a A, you need to: Implement one of the advanced features.</h2>
            <p><strong>Out of the options available, I choose to use my imagination on my design to further expand additional elements I would want my mirror to have</strong></p>
            <p>I included a music button where it would play music for the user in the morning or at night when doing basic routines, it gives it a sense of realism.</p>
            <p>In addtion to the music button I also created a power button at the bottem middle of the mirror to clean the mirror screen and to just allow the user to be able to look at themselves without all the additional information.</p>
            <p>This power button clears the screen only allowing the camera reflection, so users can just use the mirror without any additional information at there disposal giving the mirror more simplicity.</p>
            <p>The music button plays a song from a copy right free music site (filmmusic.io) where your allowed to download and use free music as long as you provide attributions to the author. The song of choice was Sunny Morning </p>
